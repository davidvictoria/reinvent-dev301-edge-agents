| Chemical handling | Chemical-resistant gloves, face shield, apron |
| Electrical work | Insulated gloves, arc flash suit (as rated) |
| Working at heights | Fall protection harness, hard hat |
| Glue system maintenance | Heat-resistant gloves, face shield |

### Housekeeping Standards

1. Keep all walkways and emergency exits clear
2. Clean up spills immediately
3. Store tools and materials in designated areas
4. Dispose of waste in proper containers
5. Report any housekeeping hazards to supervisor

## Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) Procedures

### Purpose
Lockout/Tagout procedures prevent unexpected startup of equipment during maintenance, protecting workers from hazardous energy release.

### Hazardous Energy Sources
- Electrical (motors, heaters, controls)
- Pneumatic (compressed air systems)
- Hydraulic (presses, lifts)
- Mechanical (springs, gravity)
- Thermal (hot surfaces, steam)
- Chemical (process fluids)

### LOTO Procedure Steps

#### Step 1: Preparation
1. Identify all energy sources for the equipment
2. Notify affected employees of the shutdown
3. Gather required locks, tags, and blocking devices
4. Review equipment-specific LOTO procedure

#### Step 2: Shutdown
1. Follow normal equipment shutdown procedure
2. Operate stop controls to shut down equipment
3. Verify equipment has stopped completely

#### Step 3: Isolation
1. Locate all energy isolating devices
2. Isolate equipment from ALL energy sources:
   - Electrical: Open disconnects, remove fuses
   - Pneumatic: Close valves, bleed lines
   - Hydraulic: Close valves, release pressure
   - Mechanical: Block or restrain moving parts

#### Step 4: Lockout/Tagout Application
1. Apply personal lock to each energy isolating device
2. Attach completed lockout tag with:
   - Your name
   - Date and time
   - Reason for lockout
   - Expected duration
3. Each worker applies their own lock

#### Step 5: Stored Energy Release
1. Release or restrain all stored energy:
   - Discharge capacitors
   - Bleed pneumatic/hydraulic lines
   - Block elevated components
   - Allow hot surfaces to cool

#### Step 6: Verification
1. Verify all personnel are clear of equipment
2. Attempt to start equipment using normal controls
3. Return controls to OFF position
4. Test for absence of voltage (electrical)
5. Verify zero energy state

### LOTO Removal Procedure

1. Inspect work area - ensure all tools removed
2. Verify all guards are reinstalled
3. Ensure all personnel are clear
4. Remove your lock and tag
5. Notify affected employees
6. Restore energy and test equipment

### Group Lockout Procedures

When multiple workers service the same equipment:
1. Primary authorized employee coordinates lockout
2. Each worker applies personal lock to group lockbox
3. Group lockbox key locked to energy isolation points
4. Each worker removes own lock when work complete
5. Primary employee removes group lock last

## Machine Guarding

### Guard Requirements

All moving parts must be guarded if they present a hazard:
- Point of operation (where work is performed)
- Power transmission (belts, pulleys, gears, chains)
- Other moving parts (rotating shafts, flywheels)

### Types of Guards

**Fixed Guards:**
- Permanently attached to machine
- Require tools for removal
- Preferred method when access not frequently needed

**Interlocked Guards:**
- Connected to machine control system
- Machine stops when guard is opened
- Required where frequent access needed

**Adjustable Guards:**
- Allow adjustment for different operations
- Must be secured in position during operation

### Guard Inspection Checklist

Daily verification:
- [ ] All guards in place and secure
- [ ] Interlocks functioning correctly
- [ ] No gaps allowing access to hazards
- [ ] Guards not damaged or modified
- [ ] Warning labels visible and legible

**NEVER operate equipment with guards removed or bypassed.**

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Stop (E-STOP) Locations

E-STOP buttons are located:
- At each operator station
- Every 10 meters along conveyor lines
- At all entry/exit points to equipment areas
- On mobile equipment control panels

**E-STOP buttons are RED with YELLOW background.**

### Emergency Response Procedures

#### Fire Emergency
1. Activate fire alarm (pull station)
2. Press all E-STOPs in immediate area
3. Evacuate via nearest safe exit
4. Assemble at designated muster point
5. Account for all personnel
6. Do not re-enter until authorized

#### Medical Emergency
1. Call for help - notify supervisor
2. Call emergency services (911 or internal emergency number)
3. Do not move injured person unless in immediate danger
4. Apply first aid if trained
5. Stay with injured person until help arrives
6. Direct emergency responders to location

#### Chemical Spill
1. Evacuate immediate area
2. Notify supervisor and EHS department
3. Consult Safety Data Sheet (SDS)
4. If trained, contain spill with appropriate materials
5. Do not wash chemicals into drains
6. Document incident

#### Electrical Emergency
1. Do not touch person in contact with electricity
2. Disconnect power if safe to do so
3. Call for emergency assistance
4. If person is free of electrical contact, begin first aid
5. Treat for shock and burns

### Evacuation Routes

- Primary and secondary evacuation routes posted at all exits
- Emergency lighting activates during power failure
- Assembly points located in parking lot areas A, B, and C
- Supervisors responsible for headcount at assembly points
