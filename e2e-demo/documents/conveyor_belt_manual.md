### Overview

The CB-2000 Industrial Conveyor Belt System is designed for continuous material transport in manufacturing and packaging environments. This manual covers operation, maintenance, and troubleshooting procedures.

### Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Belt Width | 600mm |
| Maximum Load | 500 kg/m |
| Speed Range | 0.1 - 2.5 m/s |
| Motor Power | 5.5 kW |
| Operating Temperature | -10°C to 50°C |
| Belt Material | Reinforced PVC |

### Components

1. **Drive Unit**: 5.5 kW three-phase motor with variable frequency drive (VFD)
2. **Belt Assembly**: Continuous loop reinforced PVC belt with tracking guides
3. **Tensioning System**: Spring-loaded automatic tensioner with manual adjustment
4. **Safety Guards**: Full-length side guards with emergency stop integration
5. **Sensors**: Proximity sensors for belt tracking and speed monitoring

### Operating Procedures

#### Startup Sequence

1. Verify all safety guards are in place
2. Check belt tension indicator (green zone = OK)
3. Confirm emergency stops are reset
4. Enable power at main disconnect
5. Set desired speed on VFD control panel
6. Press START button to begin operation

#### Normal Operation

- Monitor belt tracking via side sensors
- Check motor temperature indicator (should be < 80°C)
- Verify load distribution is even across belt width
- Listen for unusual sounds (grinding, squealing)

#### Shutdown Sequence

1. Allow belt to clear of materials
2. Press STOP button
3. Wait for belt to come to complete stop
4. Disable power at main disconnect if extended shutdown

### Maintenance Schedule

#### Daily Checks
- Visual inspection of belt surface for damage
- Check belt tracking alignment
- Verify emergency stops function correctly
- Clean debris from rollers and guides

#### Weekly Maintenance
- Lubricate drive chain (use ISO VG 68 oil)
- Check belt tension and adjust if necessary
- Inspect motor cooling fan operation
- Clean photoelectric sensors

#### Monthly Maintenance
- Full belt inspection for wear and damage
- Check roller bearings for play
- Verify VFD parameters match specifications
- Test all safety interlocks

#### Annual Maintenance
- Replace drive belt
- Full motor inspection and bearing replacement if needed
- Calibrate all sensors
- Update control system firmware

### Safety Information

**WARNING**: Always lock out/tag out before performing maintenance.

- Never reach into moving conveyor
- Keep loose clothing and hair away from moving parts
- Maximum personnel load: 100 kg (for maintenance access only)
- Emergency stops located every 10 meters along conveyor length

### Alarm Codes

| Code | Description | Action |
